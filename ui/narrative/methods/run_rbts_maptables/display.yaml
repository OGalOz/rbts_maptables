parameters :
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Target Genome   
        short-hint : |
            The Genome you're checking your reads against to find locations of barcodes.
        long-hint  : |
            This is the genome to whose genes we are going to match barcodes so they can be used to measure the abundance of strains with those genes interrupted.
    tnseq_model_name :
        ui-name : |
           TnSeq Model Name
        short-hint : |
            The RBTnSeq Transposon TnSeq Model used when inserting Barcodes 
        long-hint  : |
            The RBTnSeq TnSeq Model used when inserting Barcodes. If you used a model
            not included in the list you can add one by contacting Omree ogaloz@lbl.gov.
    fastq_ref_list :
        ui-name : |
            FastQ Mapping Reads
        short-hint : |
            The reads in FASTQ format as a KBase Single End Library Object.
        long-hint  : |
            The Map Tn Seq Program takes a set of Reads objects and maps the embedded barcodes to a location in the genome.
    maxReads :
        ui-name : |
            max Reads per FASTQ
        short-hint : |
            An integer. The total number of reads to parse in the FASTQ input files.
        long-hint : |
    minQuality :
        ui-name : |
            min Quality
        short-hint : |
            An integer. The minimum quality (from Illumina) for all nucleotides for a barcode to pass.
        long-hint : |
    minIdentity :
        ui-name : |
            min Identity
        short-hint : |
            Integer. Minimum Identity for read against genome to be counted as a map to the location.
        long-hint : |
            Input to BLAT 8
    minScore :
        ui-name : |
            min Score
        short-hint : |
            Integer. minimum length of mapping to genome or past-end of model and input to BLAT
        long-hint : |
    delta :
        ui-name : |
            delta 
        short-hint : |
            Integer. minimum length of mapping to genome or past-end of model
        long-hint : |
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
           Output Name 
        short-hint : |
            The name of your output files.
        long-hint  : |
            Give a name with no spaces or special characters.
